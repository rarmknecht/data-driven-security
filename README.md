## Data Driven Security

This repo is meant to store my work as I go through each chapter in the book 
"Data Driven Security" by Jay Jacobs & Bob Rudis. I work on multiple machines 
across both Windows and Linux. Having access from any machine via
GitHub immensely improves the value I receive from the book.

Check out the Authors' [Home Page](http://datadrivensecurity.info/) for the 
book, the blog, and the podcast.
